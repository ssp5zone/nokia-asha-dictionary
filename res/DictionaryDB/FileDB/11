Syn.
 -- Excuse. An apology, in the original sense of the word, was a
pleading off from some charge or imputation, by explaining and
defending one's principles or conduct. It therefore amounted to a
vindication. One who offers an apology, admits himself to have been,
at least apparently, in the wrong, but brings forward some palliating
circumstance, or tenders a frank acknowledgment, by way of
reparation. We make an apology for some breach of propriety or
decorum (like rude expressions, unbecoming conduct, etc.), or some
deficiency in what might be reasonably expected. We offer an excuse
when we have been guilty of some breach or neglect of duty; and we do
it by way of extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven.
When an excuse has been accepted, an apology may still, in some
cases, be necessary or appropriate. "An excuse is not grounded on the
claim of innocence, but is rather an appeal for favor resting on some
collateral circumstance. An apology mostly respects the conduct of
individuals toward each other as equals; it is a voluntary act
produced by feelings of decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of
others." Crabb.
