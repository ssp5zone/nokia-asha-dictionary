fall; pertaining to a propagated alternating motion, similar to that
of waves. Undulatory theory, or Wave theory (of light) (Opt.), that
theory which regards its various phenomena as due to undulations in
an ethereal medium, propagated from the radiant with immense, but
measurable, velocities, and producing different impressions on the
retina according to their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of
brightness depending on the former, that of color on the latter. The
undulations are supposed to take place, not in the direction of
propagation, as in the air waves constituting sound, but
transversely, and the various phenomena of refraction, polarization,
interference, etc., are attributable to the different affections of
these undulations in different circumstances of propagation. It is
computed that the frequency of the undulations corresponding to the
several colors of the spectrum ranges from 458 millions of millions
per second for the extreme red ray, to 727 millions of millions for
the extreme violet, and their lengths for the same colors, from the
thirty-eight thousandth to the sixty thousandth part of an inch. The

UNIVERSITY
U`ni*ver"si*ty, n.; pl. Universities. Etym: [OE. universite, L.
universitas all together, the whole, the universe, a number of
persons associated into one body, a society, corporation, fr.
universus all together, universal: cf. F. université. See Universe.]

1. The universe; the whole. [Obs.] Dr. H. More.

2. An association, society, guild, or corporation, esp. one capable
of having and acquiring property. [Obs.]
The universities, or corporate bodies, at Rome were very numerous.
There were corporations of bakers, farmers of the revenue, scribes,
and others. Eng. Cyc.

3. An institution organized and incorporated for the purpose of
imparting instruction, examining students, and otherwise promoting
education in the higher branches of literature, science, art, etc.,
empowered to confer degrees in the several arts and faculties, as in
theology, law, medicine, music, etc. A university may exist without
having any college connected with it, or it may consist of but one
college, or it may comprise an assemblage of colleges established in
any place, with professors for instructing students in the sciences
and other branches of learning.
The present universities of Europe were, originally, the greater part
of them, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of
churchmen . . . What was taught in the greater part of those
universities was suitable to the end of their institutions, either
theology or something that was merely preparatory to theology. A.
Smith.

Note: From the Roman words universitas, collegium, corpus, are
derived the terms university, college, and corporation, of modern
languages; and though these words have obtained modified
significations in modern times, so as to indifferently applicable to
the same things, they all agree in retaining the fundamental
signification of the terms, whatever may have been added to them.
There is now no university, college, or corporation, which is not a
juristical person in the sense above explained [see def. 2, above];
wherever these words are applied to any association of persons not
stamped with this mark, it is an abuse of terms. Eng. Cyc.
