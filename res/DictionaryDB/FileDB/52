seek or search for, to bring together, LL., to conquer; con- +
quaerere to seek. See Quest.]

Syn.
 -- To subdue; vanquish; overcome; overpower; overthrow; defeat;
rout; discomfit; subjugate; reduce; humble; crush; surmount; subject;
master.
 -- To Conquer, Vanquish, Subdue, Subjugate, Overcome. These words
agree in the general idea expressed by overcome, -- that of bringing
under one's power by the exertion of force. Conquer is wider and more
general than vanquish, denoting usually a succession of conflicts.
Vanquish is more individual, and refers usually to a single conflict.
Thus, Alexander conquered Asia in a succession of battles, and
vanquished Darius in one decisive engagement. Subdue implies a more
gradual and continual pressure, but a surer and more final
subjection. We speak of a nation as subdued when its spirit is at
last broken, so that no further resistance is offered. Subjugate is
to bring completely under the yoke of bondage. The ancient Gauls were
never finally subdued by the Romans until they were completely
subjugated. These words, when used figuratively, have correspondent
meanings. We conquer our prejudices or aversions by a succesion of
conflicts; but we sometimes vanquish our reluctance to duty by one
decided effort: we endeavor to subdue our evil propensities by
watchful and persevering exertions. Subjugate is more commonly taken
in its primary meaning, and when used figuratively has generally a
bad sense; as, his reason was completely subjugated to the sway of
his passions.
