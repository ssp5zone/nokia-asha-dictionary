religion. Paley.

Note: Religion, as distinguished from theology, is subjective,
designating the feelings and acts of men which relate to God; while
theology is objective, and denotes those ideas which man entertains
respecting the God whom he worships, especially his systematized
views of God. As distinguished from morality, religion denotes the
influences and motives to human duty which are found in the character
and will of God, while morality describes the duties to man, to which
true religion always influences. As distinguished from piety,
religion is a high sense of moral obligation and spirit of reverence
or worship which affect the heart of man with respect to the Deity,
while piety, which first expressed the feelings of a child toward a
parent, is used for that filial sentiment of veneration and love
which we owe to the Father of all. As distinguished from sanciti,
religion is the means by which sanctity is achieved, sanctity
denoting primarily that purity of heart and life which results from
habitual communion with God, and a sense of his continual presence.
Natural religion, a religion based upon the evidences of a God and
his qualities, which is supplied by natural phenomena. See Natural
theology, under Natural.
 -- Religion of humanity, a name sometimes given to a religion

 -- Revealed religion, that which is based upon direct communication
of God's will to mankind; especially, the Christian religion, based
on the revelations recorded in the Old and New Testaments.

Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane, I can not taint with fear.
Shak.

Note: The verb remove, in some of its application, is synonymous with
move, but not in all. Thus we do not apply remove to a mere change of
posture, without a change of place or the seat of a thing. A man
moves his head when he turns it, or his finger when he bends it, but
he does not remove it. Remove usually or always denotes a change of
place in a body, but we never apply it to a regular, continued course
or motion. We never say the wind or water, or a ship, removes at a
certain rate by the hour; but we say a ship was removed from one
place in a harbor to another. Move is a generic term, including the
sense of remove, which is more generally applied to a change from one
station or permanent position, stand, or seat, to another station.
