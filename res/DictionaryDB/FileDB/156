Met`a*phys"ics, n. Etym: [Gr. métaphysique. See Physics. The term was

physics.]

1. The science of real as distinguished from phenomenal being;
ontology; also, the science of being, with reference to its abstract
and universal conditions, as distinguished from the science of
determined or concrete being; the science of the conceptions and
relations which are necessarily implied as true of every kind of
being; phylosophy in general; first principles, or the science of
first principles.

Note: Metaphysics is distinguished as general and special. General
metaphysics is the science of all being as being. Special metaphysics
is the science of one kind of being; as, the metaphysics of
chemistry, of morals, or of politics. According to Kant, a systematic
exposition of those notions and truths, the knowledge of which is
altogether independent of experience, would constitute the science of
metaphysics.
Commonly, in the schools, called metaphysics, as being part of the
philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title; but it is in
another sense: for there it signifieth as much as "books written or
placed after his natural philosophy." But the schools take them for
"books of supernatural philosophy;" for the word metaphysic will bear
both these senses. Hobbes.
Now the science conversant about all such inferences of unknown being
from its known manifestations, is called ontology, or metaphysics
proper. Sir W. Hamilton.
Metaphysics are [is] the science which determines what can and what
can not be known of being, and the laws of being, a priori.
Coleridge.

2. Hence: The scientific knowledge of mental phenomena; mental
philosophy; psychology.
Metaphysics, in whatever latitude the term be taken, is a science or
complement of sciences exclusively occupied with mind. Sir W.
Hamilton.
Whether, after all, A larger metaphysics might not help Our physics.
